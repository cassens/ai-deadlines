## Adding/updating a conference

This list builds upon the listing of top-tier AI conferences at [aideadlin.es][2]. The aim is to expand that list with conferences in some other areas of research I am active in. Feel free to either contribute to this listing if it matches your research profile or to maintain a separate fork of the original listing for your own area.

To add or update information:
- Fork the repository
- Update `_data/conferences.yml`
- Make sure it has the `name`, `longname`, `year`, `id`, `link`, `deadline`, `timezone`, `date`, `place` attributes
- Send a pull request
