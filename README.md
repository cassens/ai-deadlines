## Conference Deadlines

Countdown timers to keep track of a bunch of conference deadlines related to AI, HCI, SFL, Ambient Systems, Context.

## Adding/updating a conference

I am trying to expand the listing of top-tier AI conferences [abhshkdz/ai-deadlines][6] with conferences in the area of Human-Computer Interaction, Systemic-Functional Theory of Language, Ambient and Contextualized Computing as well as some specific AI areas. Feel free to maintain a separate fork of the original listing if you do not see your sub-field or conference of interest listed, or amend this list if you feel some events are not represented. 

To add or update information:
- Fork the repository
- Update `_data/conferences.yml`
- Make sure it has the `name`, `year`, `id`, `link`, `deadline`, `timezone`, `date`, `place` attributes
- Send a pull request
